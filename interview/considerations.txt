- ask if input is valid -> ex if binary tree, ask if binary tree exists and is a valid tree

- ask if it's ok to modify input array -> ex if 2d array like Number of Islands should I use visit set or can I
-- modify input array to set visited island to 0

- for graphs and linked lists, make sure to ask that I can assume there are no cycles/loops
-- for graphs, also ask to make sure input is valid like there are no negative weights etc

- for questions with integer addition or multiplication, ask to make sure that I can assume no integer overflow
-- ask if I can assume all intermediate calculations will also not overflow in the process -> useful for binary search when using (l + r) // 2
-- for any questions that require division, ask to make sure that I can assume that there will be no division by 0

- for questions where input number is a string
-- ask about existence of leading 0s
-- ask if I can convert the entire number to an int without overflow
--- or if I should solve using pointers

- ask for question constraints
-- like array length
-- all numbers are unique
-- all positive numbers or if negative numbers are also included
