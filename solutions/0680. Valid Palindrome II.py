Title: Valid Palindrome II
URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome-ii/description/
Difficulty: Easy
Tags: Meta, Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft
Topics: Two Pointers
String
Greedy

Approach:
- want to do two pointers starting from each end
- if we ever encounter a place where s[l] != s[r], we want to check if the middle of the string is a palindrome
- needs to be checked twice, once where you ignore s[l] and once where you ignore s[r]
- if it is a palindrome after skipping, return True, else return False
- return True at the end because the original string is a palindrome and question asks for "at most one"


Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n) -> NOTE: this approach might use extra space because of substring using the indexes
                                - we could just have a separate function that checks for palindrome using same
                                - two pointer method. this would be O(1) space

"""
Question:

Given a string s, return true if the s can be palindrome after deleting at most one character from it.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "aba"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "abca"
Output: true
Explanation: You could delete the character 'c'.
Example 3:

Input: s = "abc"
Output: false
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
s consists of lowercase English letters.
